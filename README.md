# ðŸ§  Host Header Injection Labs â€“ Web Security Academy

This repository contains detailed walkthroughs for the Host Header Injection labs offered by PortSwigger's Web Security Academy. These labs demonstrate how attackers can exploit misconfigured or insecure handling of the `Host` header to perform various attacks, such as password reset poisoning, cache poisoning, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Labs Covered
